The myth concludes with Pygmalion marrying Galatea, and together they "bore a son, Paphos" :inline-cite[Kline 220-297]. While Galatea's physical transformation is complete, it is the marriage and birth of a son that truly marks the end of her arc.

This raises the question: what changed about her from beginning to end? Galatea's appearance remains constant throughout the story. In Pygmalion's eyes her appearance was always pure and perfect. What truly changes, and ultimately completes her arc, is her ability to fulfill the expected role of a woman in Roman society. Roman women were expected to undergo "marriage and childbearing" :inline-cite[Tursi] and while Galatea's beauty was a good start for her, it was her transition into a wife and mother that brought the story to its conclusion. This narrative arc reinforces the societal belief that a woman's primary role is to serve men. Galatea's physical perfection was insufficient. Only when she is given the ability to marry and have children is she considered truly alive and valuable in the eyes of Pygmalion and Roman society as a whole. Pygmalion's "happy ending" is completed with his marriage. On the other hand, Galatea's happiness remains uncertain because it was never explicitly stated. The myth thus reflects and reinforces Roman societal norms, where a woman's worth was largely defined by her roles as a wife and mother. Galatea's transformation is complete not when she becomes human, but when she fulfills these societal expectations.
