Upon returning home, Pygmalion touches and kisses Galatea, only to be startled by her warmth. Surprised, he presses "his lips to her again" and touches "her breast with his hand," amazed to find that the statue has "lost its hardness" and become a living human.

Both Pygmalion and his new lover kiss and look to the sky, thanking Venus (Kline 220-297). By modern standards, this scene depicts relationships in a very simplistic way. Pygmalion pushes Galatea into an intimate relationship from the moment she awakens. While Pygmalion is excited about the prospect of marrying Galatea, the myth does not say anything about Galatea's feelings or perspective making the relationship very one-sided. This one-sided narrative suggests to readers that in Roman times, a man's feelings were the only ones that mattered during a relationship. A woman's primary purpose in the Roman household was to empower and please the man, thus reflecting how women were perceived in "a subordinate position to men" in Roman society (Tursi). Galatea effectively pleases Pygmalion, and thus the story depicts the event in a very positive light as she successfully fulfilled the traditional role of a woman.
