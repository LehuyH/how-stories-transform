Ovid completed Metamorphoses by 8 CE, **well into the reign of Roman Emperor Augustus**. At the time, Augustus was ushering in a new era of religious revival as he began to re-establish "traditional social rules and religious rituals" :inline-cite[The Roman Empire].

He accomplished this goal in a variety of ways. For example, he oversaw the construction of religious monuments to "promote and encourage traditional Roman religion". He later re-established priesthoods and revived a number of "past ceremonies and festivals" before introducing new religious practices such as the "worship of the Emperor as a god" :inline-cite[Fife]. These changes were "very popular" among Romans and their positive reception demonstrates the importance of religion in Roman society during Augustus' reign :inline-cite[The Roman Empire]. For example, gods and religion play a central role in Ovid's Metamorphoses, where many stories recount interactions between gods and mortals. In these stories, the gods often symbolize broader societal values and religious ideals.
