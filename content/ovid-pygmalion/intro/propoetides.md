**The Propoetides** are a group of girls who reside in Amathus, a city dedicated to the goddess Venus.

 However, because these girls "dared to deny that Venus was the goddess," Venus punished them by making them "the first to prostitute their bodies" and removing their sense of shame. As a result, these girls spent the rest of their lives in "wickedness" :inline-cite[(Kline 220-297)]. This punishment serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of disrespecting religion. As illustrated by the Propoetides' fate, those who committed such acts often faced social ostracism and suggests that a significant source of social standing in Roman society stems from one's devotion to the gods. In this context, the Propoetides symbolize those at the lowest ranks of Roman social hierarchy.
