Pygmalion, a Cyprian sculptor, witnesses the Propoetides' new behavior firsthand and is utterly "offended" by what he sees. 
<!--more-->
He attributes their behavior to a "failing" of the "female heart". Disillusioned, he decides to remain a bachelor for the rest of his life, focusing on his sculpting instead. Pygmalion's decision to permanently remove women from his life after only seeing the Propoetides once is a significant decision, but his high standards likely due to his profession. Roman sculpture is heavily influenced by the "idealised perfection" of classical Greek art. Roman aristocrats often commissioned sculptors like Pygmalion to create "idealistic" works, so having a keen eye for perfection was a must-have skill for a sculptor at the time :inline-cite[Cartman]. The Propoetides, with their newly acquired behavior, are a strong departure from this perfection. For a sculptor like Pygmalion, who is accustomed to idealistic sculpting, their new imperfections are especially upsetting, which explains his extreme decision to abandon romantic relationships entirely.
