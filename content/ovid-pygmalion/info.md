# Metamorphoses & Pygmalion
Ovid's *Metamorphoses* is widely regarded as his best-known work. Written in 8 CE, the book is a collection of Greek myths and legends that share the same theme of transformation and passion. The stories in this book often revolve around a characterâ€™s "obedience or disobedience toward the gods" and how they were "rewarded or punished by a final transformation" based on their actions :inline-cite[Kenney]. The Pygmalion myth, the primary focus of this research project, was first interpreted in book ten of Ovid's Metamorphoses. This version of the myth in Metamorphoses is the foundational text that was the major source of inspiration for later works studied in this project.
