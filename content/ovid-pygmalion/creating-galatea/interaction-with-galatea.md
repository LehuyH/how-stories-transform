Pygmalion treats Galatea like she's a real woman. "He runs his hands over" her, "speaks" and "kisses" her. He even presents Galatea with luxurious clothing and jewelry.

 Even with all of these accessories, Galatea "appears no less lovely, naked" and proudly refers to the statue as his "bedfellow" :inline-cite[Kline 220-297]. Here, Pygmalion is expressing a very lustful attitude towards the statue, which raises a double standard. His behavior is not so different from that of the Propoetides he earlier condemned which further highlights the inequality in societal expectations women faced in the Roman Empire. For example, adultery was only considered a crime when "committed by a woman," while "men were exempt from such behaviors" :inline-cite[Tursi]. This scene reinforces these values, as Pygmalion's actions, though lustful, are not portrayed in nearly as negative a light as those of the Propoetides suggesting a deeper gender bias in Roman society.
