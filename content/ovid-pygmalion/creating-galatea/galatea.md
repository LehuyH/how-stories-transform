Repulsed by the corruption of mortal women, Pygmalion creates what he considers to be the ideal woman. He makes a statue of a young woman, later named Galatea, that is so lifelike that it appears as if it "wished to move"

:inline-cite[Kline 220-297]. Galatea is a completely man-made statue that represents everything an ideal woman should be in Roman times, specifically pure. 
Writers of the Augustan Age, including Ovid, often portrayed women as "sex-driven" and "uncontrollable," as symbolized by the Propoetides :inline-cite[Tursi]. In contrast, Galatea, being a man-made statue, lacks any will of her own. This absence of agency frees her from these negative female stereotypes, making her pure by default.
