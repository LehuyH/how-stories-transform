Venus, the Roman goddess of "love, sex, beauty, and fertility," serves as a symbol of both religion and societal expectations in the Pygmalion myth

:inline-cite[Garcia]. As the moral judge of the story, the goddess punishes those who defy her values, such as the Propoetides, while rewarding those who uphold them. This dynamic mirrors the societal pressures faced by Roman women, who were expected to conform to ideals of "marriage and motherhood" :inline-cite[Tursi].  Actions that went against these norms, like adultery, were severely condemned.
