Despite Galatea's perfect appearance, Pygmalion is still disappointed that she is an inanimate ivory statue. To solve this, Pygmalion attends one of Venus's festivals and he makes an offering.

 He prays for a bride "like [his] ivory girl" and as "a sign of the gods' fondness," the festival flames flare up three times :inline-cite[Kline 220-297]. This divine acknowledgment suggests that one cannot achieve their desires without the gods' approval and goodwill. The necessity of Venus's intervention to bring Pygmalion a wife like Galatea demonstrates the role religion plays in daily Roman life. They believed the gods had a direct impact on the lives of the Romans, and maintaining good faith was critical to gaining their support. By portraying divine power as the final catalyst for Pygmalion's goal of finding a pure woman, the story reinforces the Roman belief that the gods were essential in fulfilling human aspirations.
