The song "Why Can't The English" is the first major addition Lerner makes to Shaw's play. 
<!--more-->
Instead of having Professor Higgins discuss linguistics in the opening act, he now sings about it. Like in Shaw's play, Higgins represents the upper class and boasts about his linguistic knowledge. He sings that "an Englishman's way of speaking absolutely classifies him," leading to his frustrated exclamation, "why can't the English learn to speak?!" which shows his contempt for people like Eliza :inline-cite[Lerner]. As the opening song, it establishes both the setting and Higgins as a character. While the song's content closely mirrors the play, it makes the role of language in society more explicit and establishes a clear mood of frustration towards the lower class.  For characters, Lerner's intention was to use music to "dramatize" a character's "outstanding aspects," making character introductions more engaging. Believing that "Higgins was Shaw," Lerner wrote Higgins' songs as a "comedy," closely resembling Shaw's ironic writing style. To dramatize Higgins, Lerner amplified Higgins' "anger and frustration" through lyrics of mad exclamations about the English's inability to speak properly. This musical introduction differs from Shaw's play, which primarily focused on Higgins' poor manners. Here, the musical ensures that Higgins' passion for language also stands out. With the song, Lerner energizes the audience with Higgins' strong emotions while also establishing some of the necessary background knowledge about British society to understand the story.
