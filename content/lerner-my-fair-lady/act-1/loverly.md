"Wouldn't It Be Loverly," like "Why Can't The English," is another song that introduces a character.
<!--more-->
This time, it introduces Eliza, who sings about her desires for "'lots of choc'late" and someone who would "take good care of" her :inline-cite[Lerner]. At this point in the musical, Eliza has established herself as a working-class girl, and this song represents her goals. She wishes for a higher status, symbolized by chocolate, as well as love, expressed by her desire for someone to care for her. Lerner dramatizes Eliza's "cheerfulness" through the song's overall positive and hopeful tune, which excites audiences about seeing her pursue these goals. While Eliza's desire to reach a higher class matches with Shaw's play, Lerner places new emphasis on her desire for love, which doesn't appear until much later in Shaw's play. Lerner introduces this love aspect earlier to help with songwriting. Acknowledging that Shaw's play was primarily a "non-love story," Lerner had trouble with the concept of a "non-love song". Ultimately, he decided to focus on Eliza's "longing for creature comforts" :inline-cite[Lerner]. While in Shaw's play, her ambitions took on more sophisticated forms like Eliza's dream to be a lady in a flower shop, Lerner simplified these desires to be more relatable like chocolates and love. Although this approach somewhat simplifies Eliza's motivations, it makes her overall goals clearer and more accessible to the audience. This simplification aligns with the main goal of an introductory song: to establish the character's motivations. Lerner shows that Eliza isn't just pursuing the specific goal of becoming a flower shop lady; she's driven by a broader desire for these "creature comforts" that represent a better life.
