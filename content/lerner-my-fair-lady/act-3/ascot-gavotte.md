Lerner moves Eliza's first test from a small party at Mrs. Higgins' house to a high-stakes horse racing event. This change is dramatically represented in the song "The Ascot Gavotte," which portrays the upper class watching the race.

The song revolves around "waiting for the cue" for the horses to start, and when they finally race by, there's a "long, expressionless, emotionless pause" which, according to the high-class spectators, was "a frenzied moment". While the scene maintains the same conversations as Shaw's play, the new setting significantly raises the stakes for Eliza adding suspense for the audience :inline-cite[Lerner]. The song depicts the upper-class spectators as remarkably stiff. They sing in unison as a single unit which makes it clear that if Eliza acted even slightly out of character, she would stand out. Lerner also adds Shaw's irony in portraying the superficiality of upper-class Britain. He contrasts the "emotionless" appearance of the spectators with their description of the race as a "frenzied moment," despite the obvious lack of engagement. This irony is further emphasized when Eliza, breaking the silence, cheers loudly "Come on, Dover!" in her natural, lower-class accent while everyone else remains silent.
Although the test for Eliza remains essentially the same as in Shaw's original, setting this moment against the backdrop of a grand social event heightens the tension and also provides an opportunity to demonstrate Eliza's struggles with staying in character.
