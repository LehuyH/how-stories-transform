Similar to how the song "With a Little Bit O' Luck" expands on Mr. Doolittle, the song "On the Street Where You Live" breathes new life into another overlooked character: Freddy Hill.

While Shaw's epilogue mentions that Eliza eventually marries Freddy, their relationship receives little development in the original play. Lerner addresses this hole by giving Freddy a song where he expresses that there's "nowhere else on earth" he'd rather be than near Eliza (Lerner). This song allows Freddy to become a more involved character and establishes a secondary romance. By introducing this song, Lerner sets up another plot point, leaving the audience wondering whether Eliza will end up with Freddy or Higgins. The new plot point heightens the drama and gives Freddy a more intentional role, unlike his smaller part in Shaw's play. With Freddy's new character traits and romantic interest in Eliza, Lerner creates a love triangle that adds further depth and conflict to the narrative.
