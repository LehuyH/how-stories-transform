Lerner expands the story of Pygmalion by including more scenes of Higgins training Eliza to speak properly.
<!--more-->
Unlike in Shaw's play, where Eliza learns with "extraordinary quickness," Lerner's adaptation portrays the training as harsh, rigorous, and significantly challenging for Eliza :inline-cite[Shaw]. The difficulty escalates to the point where Higgins threatens Eliza, saying "there'll be no lunch, no dinner, and no chocolates" until she can correctly pronounce her vowels. After Higgins leaves, a now infuriated Eliza sings "Just You Wait," expressing her desire for vengeance. She dreams of becoming "famous" enough that the king would follow her orders to kill Higgins at her command :inline-cite[Lerner]. By including these extra training scenes and depicting Eliza's struggles, Lerner dramatizes "Eliza's fury at Higgins' inhuman treatment of her," foreshadowing further conflict :inline-cite[Lerner]. In Shaw's play, these key scenes are skipped, making the conflict less organic. The song also does a better job of showing Eliza's resilience. Even in the midst of her struggles, she remains optimistic and envisions herself as a famous lady in the future. Despite the fact that Higgins still has the upper hand in their relationship, the audience now sees Eliza's inner strength and determination which allows Lerner to create more opportunities for drama between the two in the future.
