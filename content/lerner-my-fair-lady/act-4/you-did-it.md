The song "You Did It" is another example of Lerner using music to amplify emotional moments in the story.

After Eliza's successful visit to the ambassador's party, they return to Higgins' home for a celebratory song. This song focuses on praising Higgins, with Pickering declaring that he "all alone" overcame the obstacles to help Eliza succeed. Even the servants, who usually look out for Eliza, quickly credit Higgins, singing "Congratulations, Professor Higgins, for your glorious victory!" :inline-cite[Lerner]. The main difference between Lerner's and Shaw's versions of this scene is the emotional tone. In Shaw's play, the moment after the party is more relaxed, with a sense of relief that the bet is over. Lerner, however, transforms it into a high-energy celebration. Both versions show Pickering and Higgins congratulating each other while ignoring Eliza, but Lerner's song makes this oversight more obvious with lyrics like "ev'ry bit of credit" belonging to Higgins. This change provides a contrast to the earlier celebration in "The Rain In Spain". While that song included all three main characters, "You Did It" exclusively celebrates Higgins. This contrast allows the audience to sense the growing tension and foreshadows Eliza's impending breaking point. The audience, having witnessed Eliza's hard work and transformation, can feel the injustice of her being ignored during this celebration which sets the stage for the coming conflict between Eliza and Higgins.
