In Shaw's play, the fight between Eliza and Higgins results in Eliza leaving Higgins overnight. However, the audience doesn't see the immediate aftermath of the fight. Lerner, however, fills this gap with the song "Show Me," following Eliza as she first departs from Higgins' house.

As Eliza leaves with her belongings, she encounters Freddy, who has been waiting for her. When Freddy attempts to confess his love, Eliza, still furious from her argument with Higgins, bursts into song. She tells Freddy to "don't talk at all" but instead "show" her how he loves her :inline-cite[Lerner]. This direct instruction to avoid talking is a clear rejection of Higgins, who embodies all things speech. Eliza's demand for Freddy to demonstrate his love rather than speak of it represents her desire to distance herself from anything even remotely resembling Higgins.
Despite the sad moment for Eliza, Lerner chose to make this a fast-paced song. He aimed to convey Eliza's "hurt" and "fury" through an upbeat and "agitated 5/4" tempo. Lerner noted that this song follows "a long dialogue scene," and he wanted to dramatically emphasize the impact of this moment for Eliza. This song shows Lerner's character-focused approach in contrast to Shaw's, allowing the audience to better understand Eliza's pain and why Freddy became more appealing as a lover than Higgins.
