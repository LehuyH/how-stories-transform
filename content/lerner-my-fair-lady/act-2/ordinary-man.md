While "Why Can't the English" establishes Higgins' passion for linguistics and distaste towards the lower class, another key aspect of his character is established in the song "I'm an Ordinary Man". 
<!--more-->
In this song, Higgins sings about how allowing a woman into one's life would lead to "eternal strife". He complains about a woman's tendency to whine over trivial matters and confidently declares that he "shall never let a woman" into his life :inline-cite[Lerner]. Alongside his linguistic passion, Lerner identifies misogyny as another key trait of Higgins. While this aspect is implied through his poor treatment of Eliza in Shaw's play, Lerner takes it a step further by writing this song to "dramatize Higgins' misogyny". This approach turns Higgins' misogyny a spectacle for the audience, compared to Shaw's play where Higgins simply drones on about his dislike for women. The increased focus on Higgins' misogyny serves to further pit him against Eliza, who now embodies both of his dislikes: poor language skills and femininity. This focus on character traits and conflicts shifts the focus somewhat away from Shaw's broader social criticism, placing more emphasis on the characters themselves. Lerner makes this shift intentionally as he was "drawn to Pygmalion" largely because how one can't find "wittier characters than those invented by [Shaw]" :inline-cite[Lerner].  By emphasizing these character traits and conflicts through music, Lerner aims to make the personalities and relationships in the story more central and engaging for a musical theater audience.
