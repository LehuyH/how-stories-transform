In Shaw's play, Higgins remains a firm bachelor until the very end. Lerner, on the other hand, has been foreshadowing a romance between Eliza and Higgins throughout the musical with moments like "The Rain in Spain".

The song "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face" serves as Higgins' reflection on the relationship he's built with Eliza over the past months. He sings about becoming "accustomed" to living with Eliza daily, but the song also reveals that his character hasn't fundamentally changed. Rather than reflecting on why Eliza left, he remains vengeful, singing that "she'll regret" leaving him, and when she returns, he'll "slam the door and let the hellcat freeze" :inline-cite[Lerner]. Higgins' desire for Eliza seems to stem more from her absence than from genuine love. This contrasts sharply with Eliza's lyrics in "Show Me," in which she expresses a desire for love and despite the fact that it follows a fight with Higgins, she never mentions his name. Lerner uses these two songs to give both characters a more dramatic and detailed ending to their relationship, demonstrating how they've changed :inline-cite[or not] and exploring how the story's events have affected them. The contrast between Eliza's and Higgins' songs also emphasizes their different points of view and growth throughout the story, which is a level of character development that is frequently skipped in Shaw's play after key events.
