Shaw explicitly states that Eliza does "not marry" Higgins after the play's conclusion. He asserts that as "a good-looking girl," her instinct "tells her not to marry Higgins".

For Shaw, this is the natural conclusion given Higgins' treatment of Eliza. He criticizes those who desire a happy ending for the two, accusing them of a "lazy dependence" on a happy ending that "misfits all stories" :inline-cite[Shaw]. However, unfortunately for Shaw, Lerner seems to have this "lazy dependence". In Lerner's adaptation Higgins sings "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face": a song about rejecting Eliza and calling her a "draggle-tailed guttersnipe". Yet, Eliza unexpectedly re-enters the scene, saying, "I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did,'' repeating an earlier interaction between them. This twist ending comes as a surprise, as Lerner had been heavily implying that Eliza would leave Higgins permanently. Lerner later admits that his "taste has always run toward the romantic" and that he aims "to write stories that move" him. He reflects, "it is not sadness that brings tears to [his] eyes, but a longing fulfilled." The decision to have Eliza and Higgins reconnect stems from Lerner's desire to provide a happier, more romantic ending where both characters' longings are resolved: Eliza's desire for love and Higgins' need for Eliza. While this change may satisfy audiences more and end the musical on a high note, even Lerner acknowledges that it would "drop Shaw's jaw." This change also undermines much of the social commentary on gender roles that Shaw had embedded in the story, as well as his deliberate choice for an unconventional romantic ending.
