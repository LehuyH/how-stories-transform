When Higgins agrees to teach Eliza, his first step in transforming her is to improve her appearance. Eliza is whisked away to the bathroom to clean up and try on higher-class clothes. She returns wearing "a simple blue cotton kimono," resembling a "dainty and exquisitely clean young Japanese lady" :inline-cite[Shaw].

The change is so dramatic that Mr. Doolittle fails to recognize his own daughter, addressing her as "miss" which prompts Eliza to retort with a sharp "garn!" mocking her father for not recognizing. While Eliza looks clean and more refined, she still behaves like herself speaking in her unintelligible dialect and bickering with her father. This scene parallels Ovid's myth, where Pygmalion tried to make Galatea more lifelike by giving her clothes and jewelry. In both cases, their outward appearance changes, but their fundamental nature remains the same. Galatea was still an inanimate statue incapable of interacting with Pygmalion, while Eliza still acts like a lower-class girl. While this scene shares a similar idea with Ovid's myth, Shaw presents it differently. In the original myth, the statue's immobility is an impossible obstacle. In Shaw's play, however, the issue is not fixed but rather set up as a challenge for Eliza to overcome. She must learn upper-class mannerisms, which, while difficult, is not impossible. This approach reinforces Shaw's critique of the rigid class divisions in society. He suggests that the manners and etiquette of the upper classes can be learned and appearance can be easily altered to fit in. By presenting these class features as acquirable skills rather than innate qualities, Shaw challenges the idea of having these strong class divisions when in reality the differences are not so great.
