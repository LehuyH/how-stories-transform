While Higgins is unconvinced that Eliza is worth teaching, Pickering chimes in with a bet. He wagers "all the expenses of the experiment" that Higgins won't be able to transform Eliza into a lady capable of attending the ambassador's garden party.

This challenge is all it takes to persuade Higgins, who enthusiastically declares that he'll "start today" :inline-cite[Shaw]. Higgins' sudden change of heart here reflects Britain's class divisions. He quickly dismisses Eliza's initial request reflecting how the British upper class often tried to avoid any "influence of the lower classes" :inline-cite[Brooks]. Yet, when the lessons are reframed as a test of his abilities by Pickering, a fellow high-class linguist he respects, the idea of teaching Eliza suddenly becomes irresistible. This moment marks the official start of Eliza's transformation, but the two have very different motivations. Higgins wants to prove his abilities, whereas Eliza wants to improve her social standing. Unlike Ovid's poem, which only considers Pygmalion's motivations, Shaw's iteration is much more nuanced, with two distinct motivations that foreshadow potential conflicts as the story progresses.
