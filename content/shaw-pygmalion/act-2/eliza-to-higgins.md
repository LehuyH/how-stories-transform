At the beginning of Act Two, Eliza eagerly approaches Higgins' house, asking for lessons to improve her speech. Her dream is to become "more genteel," so she can work as a lady in a flower shop rather than selling on the streets.

She's even willing to pay for these lessons. Higgins, however, is disinterested, stating that he has already collected "all the records" of her dialect and sees no further use for her :inline-cite[Shaw]. This scene marks the start of the transformation and it's already quite different from Ovid's poem. In the original myth, Pygmalion initiates and carries out Galatea's transformation without her input. Shaw inverts this dynamic and instead it's Eliza that actively seeks out her own transformation while Higgins is initially reluctant. Eliza's excitement stems from her understanding that proper speech is key to achieving her dreams. As a lower-class citizen, she has much to gain from this transformation. On the other hand, Higgins stands to gain little from interacting with Eliza apart from some money. He's already acquired the most valuable thing from her: information about her dialect. This shift in agency reflects the evolving role of women during Shaw's time. For example, in the early twentieth century, the British suffrage movement was gaining traction :inline-cite[Steinbach]. Shaw challenges the passive role that women are often assigned in traditional stories such as Ovid's Pygmalion by giving Eliza agency in her transformation.
