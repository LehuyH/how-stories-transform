The ambassador's party was a complete success! However, while Higgins and Pickering celebrate they leave Eliza alone.

Not only do they fail to acknowledge her, but they have the audacity to downplay the event, calling it nothing better than "purgatory". This infuriates Eliza as she realizes she was nothing more than a doll to these men, who now seem ready to discard her now that she has served their purpose. After Pickering leaves, Eliza confronts Higgins, asking, "what's to become of me?" Higgins responds dismissively, prompting Eliza to lash out, saying he "wouldn't care" if she was "dead." The argument escalates to the point where they nearly hit each other. At the end, Higgins eventually calls it a night, and Eliza declares that she will no longer do as he asks. When Higgins slams the door as he leaves, Eliza "smiles for the first time" :inline-cite[Shaw].
Unlike in Pygmalion, where Galatea had no say in her fate after the transformation, Shaw gives Eliza a fierce and clear voice. She calls out Higgins' poor treatment of her as if she were an object and implies that she will leave if he doesn't care about what's happening to her. This moment of defiance brings her the first real happiness she's felt resulting in her smile. Throughout her time with Higgins, Eliza has come to realize that she was merely serving his pride. Now that the lessons are over, she feels somewhat lost, having spent months doing nothing else. However, this is also an opportunity, as she now has the freedom to act on her own desires. Typically, one might expect the story to end with the heroine marrying the hero. However, Shaw writes that this is a "thoughtless assumption" and that anyone with a "feminine instinct" would know better. Once again, Shaw subverts expectations and flips the romance narrative on its head. This change reinforces his critique of traditional gender roles, asserting that women are more than just servants or potential wives to men as the original myth from Ovid might otherwise suggest.
