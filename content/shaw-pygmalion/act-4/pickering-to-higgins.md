The ambassador's party was a complete success! Higgins and Pickering are impressed by Eliza's great performance and begin to congratulate each other.

They excitedly recount the events of the night, with Pickering declaring that Higgins has "won" the bet and calling it a "triumph". Higgins on the other hand expresses relief that the event is "over and done with," admitting that "the whole thing has been a bore". They quickly exchange a final congratulations and call it for the night, all without saying a word to Eliza :inline-cite[Shaw]. To Higgins and Pickering, the completed transformation is a happy ending. Much like Pygmalion in the original myth, once the transformation is finished, they continue on as they please. Pygmalion immediately marries Galatea, while Higgins and Pickering immediately dismiss Eliza. In both cases, the men act with no regard for their creation's feelings or desires. While Ovid's story ended here with the men's satisfaction at the successful transformation, Shaw is only reaching his climax. The two men freely discuss the event in front of Eliza as if she isn't present, but unlike Galatea, Eliza advocates for herself and confronts Higgins shortly after Pickering leaves. Shaw uses these men to symbolize the perspective of the past. Their attitude reflects the established social and gender structures. By introducing Eliza as a conflicting point, Shaw represents the clash between old and new culture in his time.
