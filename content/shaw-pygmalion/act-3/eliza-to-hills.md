For Eliza, her conversation with the Hills is the first test of her transformation. Having learned the basics of proper speech from Higgins, the test is to see if she can interact with upper class people without outing herself.

Eliza makes a strong initial impression, entering with "remarkable distinction" and speaking with "correctness of pronunciation and great beauty of tone." However, the content of her speech is not as remarkable. She discusses her belief that her aunt was murdered and talks about the weather in an overly verbose manner. Fortunately, Higgins manages to pass this off as the "new small talk," which the Hills accept and even engage with. While Eliza doesn't fool Mrs. Higgins, she does seem to convince the Hills, meaning that there's been some decent progress :inline-cite[Shaw]. This gradual transformation contrasts sharply with Ovid's myth, where the change was instantaneous. Here, the transformation results from tireless effort by both Eliza and Higgins. To her credit, Eliza learns with "extraordinary quickness," and much of her progress is due to her own efforts, unlike in Ovid's poem where the transformation was solely the work of Venus and Pygmalion. Eliza's ability to fool the upper-class Hills allows Shaw to expand his criticism of class divisions. He demonstrates how, with sufficient skill, a girl from the lowest social classes could pass as a member of the upper class within a few months. This further questions the value of a rigid social structure based on such superficial elements.
