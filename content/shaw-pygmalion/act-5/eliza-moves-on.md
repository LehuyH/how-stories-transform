The final conversation between Eliza and Higgins is far from romantic.
<!--more-->
 Despite Eliza's transformation into a lady, Higgins remains unchanged in his manners, calling her "a common idiot" until the very end. Eliza retaliates, labeling Higgins a "cruel tyrant" and declaring her intentions to marry Freddy and teach with a rival linguistics professor. Higgins takes offense and says that won't allow his "masterpiece thrown away on Freddy". Eliza claims that Higgins has no control over her as they are now equals. Eliza knows everything Higgins does on how to speak properly and, unlike Higgins, she can be "civil and kind to people". She revels in her newfound independence, which she had previously overlooked. As Higgins realizes he might lose his creation, he desperately claims he will "make a woman" out of Eliza and admits he likes her. However, it's too late and Eliza leaves the house. In denial, Higgins asks her to buy groceries, to which Eliza firmly replies, "buy them yourself" :inline-cite[Shaw]. This final scene eliminates any possibility of a last-minute reconnection. Shaw makes it very clear that Eliza does not marry Higgins. The message to the audience is clear: women are not subservient to men, even if a man claims to have "created" them which strongly reflects the first wave of feminism that Shaw experienced. While the play draws heavy inspiration from Ovid's myth, the messages couldn't be more different. Shaw uses Ovid's myth and the tropes of romance, but subverts them to criticize what they once stood for: upholding established social beliefs. By turning these familiar narratives upside down, Shaw uses the format to instead critique both the gender and social structures that gripped British society.
