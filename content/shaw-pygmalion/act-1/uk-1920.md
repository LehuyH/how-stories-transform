The play Pygmalion takes place in early twentieth-century Britain, during the tail end of the Victorian Era.

At this time, Britain was still a heavily "class-based society" and one's value in British society was primarily determined by their "gender and class". Gender dictated "almost every aspect of an individual's potential and character", while class determined one's "occupation, education, family structure, sexual behaviour, politics, and leisure activities" :inline-cite[Steinbach]. However, towards the turn of the century, rapid economic development led to the growth of the middle class. Innovations in mass production also made "clothes, souvenirs, newspapers, and more … affordable to almost everyone", while "women’s rights activism" gained momentum during this era :inline-cite[Steinbach]. These developments are the starting points of larger social change, opening the door for criticism of the established Victorian system. This criticism took many forms, including literary works such as plays like Pygmalion.
