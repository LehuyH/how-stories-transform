Henry Higgins, one of the main characters in Shaw's play, is a linguistics professor and a member of Britain's upper class.

He is well-versed in his social class's expected behaviors and boasts about his ability to pass off the flower girl "as a duchess" by teaching her how to speak properly. However, despite his deep knowledge of the upper class, Higgins himself displays poor manners. He quickly demeans the flower girl's speech upon meeting her saying she speaks "like a bilious pigeon" which offends her :inline-cite[Shaw]. In the play, Higgins is a symbol of Britain's upper class, sharing several traits with the character Pygmalion Ovid's poem. Both are skilled in their respective crafts - Higgins in linguistics and Pygmalion in sculpting. They also share a strong dislike for a perceived "lower" class. Higgins dislikes those with poor English skills, while Pygmalion despises women for their perceived immoral behavior. While Pygmalion's misogyny is explicit, Higgins' dislike for the lower classes is more subtle. By disliking poor language skills, he implicitly dislikes the lower class, as being "highly educated" was associated with "well-off people" or the upper-class at the time :inline-cite[Steinbach]. For both characters, these biases are major factors driving their decisions and represent the attitudes of the ruling class in their stories.
