Colonel Pickering, like Higgins, is a member of Britain's upper class, described as an "amiable military" gentleman.

He's a foil to Higgins representing the positive traits of the upper class. For example, in the first act he freely gives Eliza "three hapence" for a flower she tries to sell him, and he quickly defends her against Higgins' harsh words, insisting that she "meant no harm" despite her lower-class status. Pickering's positive behavior in the story emphasizes Higgins' inappropriate behavior in class. Thus, Pickering represents the upper class's best traits, while Higgins represents its worst. However, Pickering and Higgins are not complete opposites. They quickly bond over their shared interest in linguistics, indicating their strong, high-class educational background :inline-cite[Shaw]. These characters allow Shaw to critique not just the class system itself, but also the varying behaviors and attitudes within each class. This variety of representation contrasts with Ovid's myth, which instead presents a single, positive image of the male upper class in Roman society.
