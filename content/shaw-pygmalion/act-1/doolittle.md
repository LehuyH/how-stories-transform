Eliza Doolittle, introduced as the flower girl, is another main character in Shaw's play. Her appearance immediately outs her as a member of the lower class.

 While her "features are no worse than" those of the other higher-class ladies in the crowd, she "is very dirty" and her speech is described as having an "unintelligible" dialect :inline-cite[Shaw]. These characteristics - her poor condition and unintelligible speech - suggest a lack of education and the need to work to support herself, a common trait of the British lower class :inline-cite[Steinbach]. As a member of the lower class, Eliza shares some similarities with Ovid's Galatea, who, as a woman, would also be considered lower class compared to men in Roman society. However unlike Galeta, who is fixed in her lower class, Eliza's situation is presented as potentially changeable. Eliza herself is physically no different from the higher-class ladies, foreshadowing that her social class may not be as fixed as it first appears. Eliza represents more than just someone of lower class. She also embodies the idea that class distinctions are largely a result of one's surroundings and conditions instead of inherent characteristics. Even in Act One, Shaw is hinting at the idea that the differences between classes could be bridged with something as simple as the "services of a dentist" :inline-cite[Shaw]. Unlike the myth, which presents the differences between women and men as absolute, Shaw sets up the differences between classes as fluid and superficial. This difference is the foundation for the play's larger critique of the British class system. By presenting class distinctions as artificial, Shaw challenges the rigid social hierarchy of his time.
