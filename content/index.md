# How Do Stories Transform?
In literature, it is common for stories to be later **interpreted, adapted, and transformed by other authors.** 

These changes are influenced by the author's personal experiences. By studying the "what" and "why" of these transformations, we can gain a better understanding of the author's message and motivation for making the changes.

In this website, you'll explore how the story of **Pygmalion & Galatea** was transformed by Shaw's **Pygmalion** and Lerner's **My Fair Lady**.
