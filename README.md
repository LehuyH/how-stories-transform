# How Do Stories Transform?

In literature, it is common for stories to be later **interpreted, adapted, and transformed by other authors.**

This repository contains the code for the website [https://pygmalion.lehuy.dev/](https://pygmalion.lehuy.dev/) which explores how the story of **Pygmalion & Galatea** was transformed by Shaw's **Pygmalion** and Lerner's **My Fair Lady**.
